# Hi, I'm Samuele Alessandro Di Silvestri — Full-Stack Developer in Progress

I build practical, scalable applications using **Python, Java, React, Spring Boot** and modern UI frameworks.  
My focus is on creating systems with real-world constraints: hardware interaction, modular architectures, and clean, maintainable code.

I’m currently working on:
- **Aquarium Control System** — a modular cross-platform interface + hardware monitor built with Java and Flutter.
- **WeatherApp** — a modern UI-first weather platform using Python and Flet principles.
- **Fullstack Meal Planner** — Spring Boot backend + React/Tailwind frontend (work in progress).

My approach:
- Ship projects that solve *actual* problems.  
- Keep the architecture clean and predictable.  
- Build interfaces that feel modern and responsive without overengineering.
